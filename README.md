## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **Email**: Resend SDK
- **Auth**: Custom token-based + Google OAuth
- **Hosting**: Railway

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm
- A PostgreSQL 18 server. `docker compose up -d` starts one matching CI and production; a
  native install (Homebrew, apt, Postgres.app) works too — set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.
  `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` are needed for `fetch-prod-db` and the backup job.

### Installation

```bash
npm run local-setup
```

This installs dependencies and Playwright browsers, restores an anonymised copy of production into your database, and runs migrations. Postgres must be running first.

### Environment

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Key variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection URL (e.g. `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/catalyse`)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — for email sending
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — for Google OAuth
- `STUB_EMAIL=true` — suppress real emails in development

### Running

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### First-Time Setup

To make yourself an admin, add your email to `.env.local`:

```env
ADMIN_EMAILS=your@email.com
```

On next login, the app will automatically grant admin access. Multiple emails can be comma-separated.

## Database & Migrations

### Local dev database

The local dev database is a copy of prod with PII anonymised, restored into whatever `DATABASE_URL` points at. Refresh it with:

```bash
npm run fetch-prod-db && npm run migrate
```

`fetch-prod-db` downloads the latest prod `pg_dump` from B2, **drops and recreates the `public` schema** of the target database, restores into it, anonymises, and seeds the dev accounts. It refuses to run when `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production`. `migrate` runs `prisma migrate deploy`, which applies any unapplied migration files in order without drift-checking.

Unit tests create a throwaway schema per test file (`vitest_*`) in the same database, and e2e workers use `e2e_<n>`; neither touches `public`.

### Adding a migration

Do **not** use `prisma migrate dev` — it checks for schema drift against the live DB and will fail. The correct workflow:

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Generate the migration file:
   ```bash
   npm run new-migration your_migration_name
   ```
   This creates `prisma/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_your_migration_name/migration.sql` with the diff SQL.
3. **Review the generated SQL** — the diff may include unrelated pending changes from other branches. Remove any statements not relevant to your change.
4. Apply it:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```
5. Regenerate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

## Testing

### Running tests

```bash
npm run test:unit       # Run unit tests only (vitest)
npm run test:e2e        # Run e2e tests only (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e:headed # Run with a visible browser (single worker, slowed)
npm run test:e2e:ui     # Open Playwright UI mode
```

Tests spin up an isolated Next.js server with a fresh database — your dev server doesn't need to be running.

The `test:e2e:dev` variants skip the build and use a dev server instead. These are for interactive development only — do not use them to verify correctness, as they skip type checking and build validation.
